This is the paper "Navigating the growing field of research on AI for software testing - the taxonomy for AI-augmented software testing and an ontology-driven literature survey" by Ina K. Schieferdecker, ORCID 0000-0001-6298-2327 and its annexes: 

- the xlsx file with the pre-selected and finally selected research papers and with the new term and synonym candidates - being the result of an exemplary ontology-driven systematic 
  literature review

- the initial version of the the ontology ai4st (the AI for software testing ontology, classifying research papers on AI for software testing along four dimensions: purpose of the solution, 
  type of AI being used, software testing concept being addressed, and AI-supported automation level aimed at/provided) that uses the initial version of the ontology stc (the software testing 
  concepts ontology including parts of the ISTQB glossary v4.5) that are grounded with the gUFO ontology.
